# Folsten Region

Folsten is a region to host D&D 5E role playing scenarios in.

## Base Setting

Unless indicated otherwise assume Folsten is a typical D&D setting.  All races, classes, and so on
from the core 5E books (Players handbook, Dungeon Masters Guide and Monster Manual) exist or could
exist in Folsten.  For setting specific content use Forgotten Realms.  For example use the
Forgotten realms Pantheon of Deities.

## Civilization

The current civilization in Folsten is relatively new.  About 200 years ago several ships landed
about where the current, aptly named, city First Landing is located. The region gets its name from
the captain of that expedition Gibard Folsten.  After some significant hardship these new
settlers turned First Landing into a safe and prosperous town.  More settlers arrived over the
years and soon this fledgling civilization was pushing deeper inland.  Kerg was established as the
second major town and over the years grew to rival First Landing with it's more central location.
Altin, Welton, and Tilos grew into the dominant towns in there areas.  More recently Mifault has
been growing as the lands beyond the mountains are tamed.  Many other small settlements and
villages exist across the land.
